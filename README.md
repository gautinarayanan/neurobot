Final Project - ENGR 120
Collaborators: Gautham, Ruben, Christal

A simple neurobot uses excel file to parse the list of FAQs a user could ask. The whole point of this python notebook was to 
practice some core concepts like importing and reading CSVs, for Loops, Nested If statements and diplaying graph visualization(word-cloud).
